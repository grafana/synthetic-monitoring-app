- We have strict linting rules. These should be abided at all times.
- When changing files ensure you clean up any lint errors that are left afterwards
- Ideally you would read the output from Cursor's ESLint server. If for any reason this is unavailable you are free to run a lint command in the terminal. This can be used in plan mode, as outlined in [modes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/modes.mdc)
- I consider errors and warnings generated by the Typescript part of linting.
