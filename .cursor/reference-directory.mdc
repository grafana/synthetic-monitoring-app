- Often I will ask you to perform tasks or audits. This information is only useful for you and me. If appropriate suggest saving it to an appropriate file in `artifacts/references`
- When we are using the reference files in the `artifacts/references` directory it may be appropriate to update or delete them. Check with me if you think something is appropriate to upate or delete. Remember to use the [modes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/modes.mdc) rule when suggesting changes.
- If appropriate suggest saving or creating things to our reference folder.
