- When creating PRs you must follow the following conventions:
- Write the PR in markdown format
- If the PR solves an open issue, start the PR description with: 'Addresses: {LINK_TO_ISSUE}'. Read the issue to gather as much context as possible when writing the PR description.
- The PR title must follow our release-please config conventions
- Add a h2 heading titled 'Problem'
- Under the problem heading, create a user-focussed statement that consists of one or more short paragraphs explaining what the current problem is prior to the changes in this PR. Keep it concise and on point.
- Add a h2 heading titled 'Solution'
- Under the solution heading create a user-focussed statement that consists of one or more paragraphs explaining how the PR adds a solution to the problem in the previous paragraph. You do not have to list the files that have been changed as that will be clear in the files changed tab in the GitHub UI.
- If appropriate add any additional headings and paragraphs with additional context.
