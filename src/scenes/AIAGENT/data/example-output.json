The Lighthouse accessibility audit identified that blue footer links (#3b82f6) have insufficient contrast (3.46:1) against the orange background (#fff7ed), falling below WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 required). This affects the 'Click here' and 'GitHub' links in the footer, potentially making them difficult to read for users with visual impairments. While this is the only accessibility issue found, it represents a clear violation of web accessibility standards that should be addressed to ensure the page is inclusive for all users.
