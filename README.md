Synthetic monitoring application
================================

Synthetic monitoring is a black box monitoring solution that provides
users with insights into how their applications and services are
behaving from an external point of view. It complements the insights
from within the applications and services we already provide through our
existing Metrics and Logs services at the core of our Grafana Cloud
platform.

Synthetic monitoring is also a demonstration of how use-case specific
applications can be built on top of Grafana and Grafana Cloud. It is the
successor to the original [worldping
application](https://grafana.net/plugins/raintank-worldping-app). The
refreshed synthetic monitoring product focuses on reducing complexity
and taking advantage of Grafana Cloud capabilities.

This is the application frontend.

* [The synthetic monitoring agent](https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent).
